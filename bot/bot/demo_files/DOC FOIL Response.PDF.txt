My investigation revealed the following:
On Monday, June 7th, 2021, Officer Mirabal #14120 assigned to 2 Lower South post on the 1500X2331 tour at approximately
1945 hours witnessed inmate Bookman, David B/C#349-20-04684, while inside of the storage cell, began to make verbal
threats towards inmate
verbally stating I am going to hurt you with this cane bro, come in
here. Inmate Bookman attempted to exit the storage cell with intent to utilize his walking cane on inmate
Other inmates
in the housing area, assisted in preventing inmate Bookman from exiting the cell with the cane, at which time, inmate
aggressively entered the storage cell and engage in an inmate on inmate fight, with closed fist punches with inmate Bookman,
Officer Mirabal #14120 gave multiple commands to stop fighting or chemical agent will be utilized. Both inmates stopped
fighting when other inmates assisted in separating both of them terminating the incidents. Both inmates were escorted out of
the area by security staff. Area supervisor was notified.
Captain Cheng#1337 interviewed inmate
: in reference to above incident, said inmate refused to provide verbal or written
statement. Based on all related reports and innate statements, this writer concluded that the charges presented has not been
substantiated. Inmate was counseled on the importance of following all DOC rules and regulations at all times. I do not
recommend a hearing for inmate
for the charges of 120.10 (Refusal to Obey Direct Order), 101.14 (Fighting), 108.11
