Client is a 37 year old African American ( Heterosexual) Male who presented to
Course, Current
Nathaniel Clinic to establish care for initial psychiatric evaluation. He reported
Medications:
that he was released from prison (out on bail) in November 2021. He was locked
up June 2020 for attempted murder. Client stated that he was "self defending"
himself in the altercation but still "took the charge for attempted murder." During
incarceration, he was diagnosed with Anxiety and Personality disorder and
frequently medicated with Thorazine and Xanax.
More recently he has been having issues with his live-in girlfriend. He found out
she was cheating on him with a guy he used to know and became very violent
with her. Client reportedly that his girlfriend uses drugs heavily and would sell her
body to anyone "for a quick fix." He also verbalized that he gets "very angry and
depressed." most times.
Last week he reportedly felt suicidal and "briefly thought" about jumping onto the
train tracks. The thought of living his five daughters fatherless kept him from
doing that.
Client reported that he wants to get better physically and mentally so he can be a
good role model for his daughters. He also needs help in getting a room
somewhere so he can stay away from his girlfriend who is now a trigger for him.
