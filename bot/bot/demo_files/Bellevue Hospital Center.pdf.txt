wires are internal, no signs of infection. Will need to see omfs for full removal as soon as possible, but is stable for
arraignment without this.

Don't wait any longer! Protect yourself and others against COVID-19!
NYC Health + Hospitals is committed to help New Yorkers fight the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the most powerful tools
to end the COVID-19 pandemic are vaccines. By getting vaccinated, you are protecting yourself, your family, your
coworkers, and your community. Being vaccinated will prevent you from:
Getting COVID-19
Becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19
Spreading COVID-19 to others
Once vaccinated, you will add to the number of people in the community who are protected. This will help us to reach herd
immunity - when a large part of the community becomes immune (protected from) COVID-19. This makes it harder for the
disease to spread.
COVID-19 vaccines are safe, free and effective!
NYC Health + Hospitals has been using Pfizer, Moderna and J&J vaccines. All three vaccines have been given Emergency
Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in United States. These vaccines have been carefully
studied both before and after the FDA's EUA. The vaccines have shown virtually no significant or long-term problems.
In a study of more than 17 million people who received Pfizer or Moderna vaccines:
Serious allergic reactions happened at a rate of only 2-4 per 1 million doses. This is safer than almost all medicines!
There are many ways to get your COVID-19 vaccine!
Anyone age 12 and older that lives in the United States can get the COVID-19 vaccine in New York City. To get your
vaccine, you can:
1. Schedule an appointment online. Go to https://tinyurl.com/NYCHHCovidVaccine or use the QR code below
on your phone:
2. Call to schedule an appointment. 1-877-VAX-4NYC (1-877-829-4692)
3. Visit one of the walk-up vaccine sites. All NYC Health + Hospitals vaccine sites welcome walk-ins. Go to
https://tinyurl.com/NYCWalkinCovidVaccine or use the QR code below on your phone:

Documents (continued)
Important things to know before you visit us for your vaccine:
Bring proof of ID. Please bring proof of your identification and date of birth. For a full list of documents that you can
bring, please visit nyc.gov/covidvaccine.
Talk to your doctor first about the vaccine if you are:
Pregnant or breastfeeding
Taking strong immune system-related medicines (e.g. steroids or chemotherapy)
Have a history of serious allergic reactions
Reschedule if you are sick. You will be unable to get the vaccine if you:
Have COVID-19, or
Are waiting for a COVID-19 test result
Please reschedule if you are not feeling well on the day of your appointment.
Bring your health insurance card. COVID-19 vaccines are free with no out of pocket costs to all New Yorkers regardless of
insurance status. But if you have health insurance, we will bill your insurance.
Stay protected - Wear a face covering to your appointment. Follow social distance guidelines.
Let's get vaccinated and fight against the pandemic together!

Date of Operation: 6/11/21
Preoperative Diagnosis: Left mandibular angle fracture
Procedures: Closed reduction with maxillomandibular fixation
Surgical Attending: Kenneth Fleisher, DDS
Assisting Surgeons: Keyur Naik, DDS MD
Anesthesiologist: John Arnold Foote, MD
Anesthesia Resident: Mizanur Ahmed, MD
Anesthesia Type: General
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Intravenous Fluid Intake: 1000cc
Urine Output: no foley
Medications Given: (Please see Anesthesia Report)
Case type: clean contaminated
Findings: closed fracture, left mandibular angle
Complications: none
Indications for Procedure:
David Bookman is a 36 y.o. male w/ PMH who presented to ED s/p assault found to have a left mandibular angle
fracture extending to the coronoid.
After discussion with the patient, the decision was made to proceed to the OR for closed reduction of above fracture.
All risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail.
All questions were answered. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, signed and witnessed, and placed in
the chart.
Procedure in Detail:
The patient was taken to the operating room awake and alert and transferred to the Operating Room table in supine
position. The care of the patient was assumed by the anesthesia service who secured peripheral IV access, induced
general anesthesia, and performed intubation without complication. Following this, the care of the patient was
transferred back to the Oral & Maxillofacial service. The patient was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. A time out procedure was performed by all present staff members.
A moistened gauze throat packing was placed in the patient's hypopharynx. Approximately 10cc of 1% Lidocaine with
1:100,000 units of epinephrine were infiltrated into the maxillary and mandibular vestibules and sufficient time was
elapsed to ensure sufficient anesthesia.
First, arch bars were cut to size and affixed to the maxillary and mandibular identition using 24-gauge stainless steel
wires. The throat pack was removed. The patient was placed into maxillomandibular fixation using heavy elastics.
After completing the surgical portion of the case, nursing noted all instrument counts were completed and correct, and
the care of the patient was returned to the anesthesia service for an uneventful emergence and extubation. The patient
was then transported to the PACU in stable condition having suffered no apparent untoward surgical or anesthetic
complications.

After discussion with the patient, the decision was made to proceed to the OR for closed reduction of above fracture.
All risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail.
All questions were answered. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, signed and witnessed, and placed in
the chart.
Procedure in Detail:
The patient was taken to the operating room awake and alert and transferred to the Operating Room table in supine
position. The care of the patient was assumed by the anesthesia service who secured peripheral IV access, induced
general anesthesia, and performed intubation without complication. Following this, the care of the patient was
transferred back to the Oral & Maxillofacial service. The patient was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. A time out procedure was performed by all present staff members.
A moistened gauze throat packing was placed in the patient's hypopharynx. Approximately 10cc of 1% Lidocaine with
1:100,000 units of epinephrine were infiltrated into the maxillary and mandibular vestibules and sufficient time was
elapsed to ensure sufficient anesthesia.
First, arch bars were cut to size and affixed to the maxillary and mandibular identition using 24-gauge stainless steel
wires. The throat pack was removed. The patient was placed into maxillomandibular fixation using heavy elastics.
After completing the surgical portion of the case, nursing noted all instrument counts were completed and correct, and
the care of the patient was returned to the anesthesia service for an uneventful emergence and extubation. The patient
was then transported to the PACU in stable condition having suffered no apparent untoward surgical or anesthetic
complications.

Patient Instructions (continued)
PAIN: Some degree of pain is normal for all patients after the procedure. Unless contraindicated, we generally
prescribe ibuprofen, tylenol (acetaminophen), or if necessary, a tylenol-narcotic combination drug to control pain.
Please attempt to control pain with ibuprofen or plain tylenol as your first line agent. If additional pain control is
necessary, you may use the narcotic containing drug as needed. Please be aware that narcotics cause drowsiness
and sometimes nausea. Do not attempt to take additional plain tylenol (acetaminophen) if you are currently taking
another medication that already contains tylenol (acetaminophen) so as to avoid overdose.
Applying Ice packs to your face and keeping your head elevated will also be helpful to control the pain and swelling.
Please also keep in mind that a sore throat is extremely common after general anesthesia; this is from the breathing
tube that was placed down your throat, and this pain should resolve quickly.
Always consult a physician or your surgeon prior to using any additional pain control medications or methods that
were not discussed prior to your discharge.
If you are experiencing Pain that can not be controlled with these methods, please inform your surgeon.
BLEEDING: Slight oozing of blood from your surgical sites is normal for the first few hours or so after surgery. For
this you should place gauze directly over the oozing sites, and add pressure to help stop bleeding. In the event of
excessive bleeding that can not be controlled with pressure, Apply a teabag over the site with more gauze and
apply continuous pressure, then proceed to the nearest emergency room and inform your doctor. Remember, slight
bleeding is acceptable, and the saliva in your mouth mixed with a small amount of blood may appear more drastic
than is.
SWELLING: Some swelling is also normal after this surgery. This will peak by about day 3 after surgery and should
gradually resolve on its own. In order to lessen the amount of swelling, please sleep with your head elevated using
pillows and apply ice packs to your face for the first 2-3 days.
CARE OF THE NOSE AND SINUSES:
If you had surgery on your upper jaw (maxilla) it is important to know that the necessary surgical treatments
occurred in the area in close proximity to your nose and sinuses. As such, some degree of swelling and local
changes in the area have occurred. This is why many patients have a complaint of sinus congestion and difficulty
breathing through their nose. This is normal, but it is important to take certain measures to ensure a good surgical
outcome and optimize your own comfort.
For the next 4-6 weeks, you should avoid blowing your nose, sneezing through your nose, or bending over.
Remember, Nasal congestion may create a feeling of not being able to breathe. If this occurs you should stay calm
and take an "over the counter" decongestant to relive it (nasal sprays or oral medicines as directed by your MD);
taking care to following the instructions on the bottle.
A humidifier and propping yourself up with pillows at night will also facilitate easier breathing.
DIET: For the next 3-7 days you should only be eating food that is soft and cool. Nothing spicy, nothing hot, nothing
crunchy or tough to chew. Your jaws are fragile after surgery, so you do not want to chew tough foods. Hot and
spicy foods can irritate your tissues after surgery and cause unnecessary bleeding

Patient Instructions (continued)
HYGIENE: Beginning tomorrow, you may gently rinse your mouth out with warm water/salt solution. You may
shower normally but avoid excessive steam or hot temperatures, as this can cause lightheadedness in the setting
of medications.
DRESSINGS: If you have any dressings/tapes/bandages applied please make note of the following: The non-
adhesive external gauze or stocking wraps may be removed at your leisure; they were placed to aid in propping
the
ice packing for you while you were recovering from anesthesia. The adhesive dressings (steri-strips/tensoplast
tapes) were placed to cover wounds and/or provide compression to prevent swelling. These adhesive tapes
should remain in place until your doctor removes them, but if they begin to wash off or fall off in the shower etc., this
is ok; they do not need to be replaced, just make sure they stay clean with gentle cleansing with soap and water.
ACTIVITY: You should avoid any strenuous activity or exercise for the next 10-14 days. Light out of bed activity
(walking, shopping, etc) starting the day of your surgery is mandatory to prevent blood clots and other pulmonary
issues. Most patients after this procedure are able to return to work/school after two days. A gradual return to your
normal daily activity is the most sensible approach.
FOLLOW UP: Please Follow up with your surgeon with the specified date noted above. Please call to make your
appointment as soon as possible.
WARNING SIGNS OF COMPLICATIONS:
Please be aware of these possible complications and inform your doctor if you encounter them.
In the event of a life-threatening emergency please call 911 and report to the nearest emergency room.
- Fevers/Chills
- Pus or foul odor/taste from surgical sites
- Excessive bleeding
- Progressive severe pain and/or swelling
- Nausea/diarrhea
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing liquids
If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at our office.

PATIENT CONSENT TO THE RELEASE OF RECORDS
FOR NYS EXTERNAL APPEAL
The patient, the patient's designee, and the patient's provider have a right to an external appeal of certain
adverse Determinations made by health plans. In the event an external appeal is filed, a consent to the release
of medical records, signed and dated by the patient, is necessary. An external appeal agent assigned by the
New York State Department of Financial Services will use this consent to obtain medical information from the
patient's health plan and health care providers. The name and address of the external appeal agent will be
provided with the request for medical information.
I authorize my health plan and providers to release all relevant medical or treatment records related to the
external appeal, including any HIV-related information, mental health treatment information, or alcohol /
substance abuse treatment information, to the external appeal agent. | understand the external appeal agent
will use this information solely to make a decision on the appeal and the information will be kept confidential
and not released to anyone else. This release is valid for one year. | may revoke my consent at any time,
except to the extent that action has been taken in reliance on it, by contacting the New York State Department
of Financial Services in writing. I understand that my health plan cannot condition treatment, enrollment,
eligibility, or payment on whether I sign this form. | acknowledge that the decision of the external appeal agent
is binding. I agree not to commence a legal proceeding against the external appeal agent to review the
agent's decision; provided, however, this shall not limit my right to bring an action against the external appeal
agent for damages for bad faith or gross negligence, or to bring an action against my health plan.

Instructions
After Your Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery:
PAIN: Some degree of pain is normal for all patients after the procedure. Unless contraindicated, we generally prescribe
ibuprofen, tylenol (acetaminophen), or if necessary, a tylenol-narcotic combination drug to control pain. Please attempt to
control pain with ibuprofen or plain tylenol as your first line agent. If additional pain control is necessary, you may use the
narcotic containing drug as needed. Please be aware that narcotics cause drowsiness and sometimes nausea. Do not
attempt to take additional plain tylenol (acetaminophen) if you are currently taking another medication that already
contains tylenol (acetaminophen) so as to avoid overdose.
Applying Ice packs to your face and keeping your head elevated will also be helpful to control the pain and swelling.
Please also keep in mind that a sore throat is extremely common after general anesthesia; this is from the breathing tube
that was placed down your throat, and this pain should resolve quickly.
Always consult a physician or your surgeon prior to using any additional pain control medications or methods that were
not discussed prior to your discharge.
If you are experiencing Pain that can not be controlled with these methods, please inform your surgeon.
BLEEDING: Slight oozing of blood from your surgical sites is normal for the first few hours or so after surgery. For this you
should place gauze directly over the oozing sites, and add pressure to help stop bleeding. In the event of excessive
bleeding that can not be controlled with pressure, Apply a teabag over the site with more gauze and apply continuous
pressure, then proceed to the nearest emergency room and inform your doctor. Remember, slight bleeding is acceptable,
and the saliva in your mouth mixed with a small amount of blood may appear more drastic than is.
SWELLING: Some swelling is also normal after this surgery. This will peak by about day 3 after surgery and should
gradually resolve on its own. In order to lessen the amount of swelling, please sleep with your head elevated using pillows
and apply ice packs to your face for the first 2-3 days.
CARE OF THE NOSE AND SINUSES:
If you had surgery on your upper jaw (maxilla) it is important to know that the necessary surgical treatments occurred in
the area in close proximity to your nose and sinuses. As such, some degree of swelling and local changes in the area have
occurred. This is why many patients have a complaint of sinus congestion and difficulty breathing through their nose. This
is normal, but it is important to take certain measures to ensure a good surgical outcome and optimize your own comfort.
For the next 4-6 weeks, you should avoid blowing your nose, sneezing through your nose, or bending over.
Remember, Nasal congestion may create a feeling of not being able to breathe. If this occurs you should stay calm and
take an "over the counter" decongestant to relive it (nasal sprays or oral medicines as directed by your MD); taking care to
following the instructions on the bottle.
A humidifier and propping yourself up with pillows at night will also facilitate easier breathing.

Instructions (continued)
DIET: For the next 3-7 days you should only be eating food that is soft and cool. Nothing spicy, nothing hot, nothing
crunchy or tough to chew. Your jaws are fragile after surgery, so you do not want to chew tough foods. Hot and spicy
foods can irritate your tissues after surgery and cause unnecessary bleeding
HYGIENE: Beginning tomorrow, you may gently rinse your mouth out with warm water/salt solution. You may shower
normally but avoid excessive steam or hot temperatures, as this can cause lightheadedness in the setting of medications.
DRESSINGS: If you have any dressings/tapes/bandages applied please make note of the following: The non-adhesive
external gauze or stocking wraps may be removed at your leisure; they were placed to aid in propping the ice packing for
you while you were recovering from anesthesia. The adhesive dressings (steri-strips/tensoplast tapes) were placed to cover
wounds and/or provide compression to prevent swelling. These adhesive tapes should remain in place until your doctor
removes them, but if they begin to wash off or fall off in the shower etc., this is ok; they do not need to be replaced, just
make sure they stay clean with gentle cleansing with soap and water.
ACTIVITY: You should avoid any strenuous activity or exercise for the next 10-14 days. Light out of bed activity (walking,
shopping, etc) starting the day of your surgery is mandatory to prevent blood clots and other pulmonary issues. Most
patients after this procedure are able to return to work/school after two days. A gradual return to your normal daily activity
is the most sensible approach.
FOLLOW UP: Please Follow up with your surgeon with the specified date noted above. Please call to make your
appointment as soon as possible.
WARNING SIGNS OF COMPLICATIONS:
Please be aware of these possible complications and inform your doctor if you encounter them.
In the event of a life-threatening emergency please call 911 and report to the nearest emergency room.
Fevers/Chills
- Pus or foul odor/taste from surgical sites
- Excessive bleeding
- Progressive severe pain and/or swelling
- Nausea/diarrhea
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing liquids
If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at our office.

Jaw Fracture Eating Plan (English)
Jaw Fracture Eating Plan
A break (fracture) of the jaw bone often needs surgery for treatment. After surgery, you will need to eat foods that can be
blended so that they can be sipped from a straw or given through a syringe. Work with a diet and nutrition specialist (dietit
ian) to create an eating plan that helps you get the nutrients you need in order to heal and stay healthy.
What are tips for following this plan?
General guidelines
All foods in this plan must be blended. Avoid nuts, seeds, skins, peels, bones, or any foods that cannot be blended to
the right consistency.
Ask your health care provider about taking a liquid multivitamin to make sure that you get all the vitamins and
minerals you need.
Cooking
Before blending, remove any skins, seeds, or peels from food.
Cook meats and vegetables until tender.
Cut foods into small pieces and mix with a small amount of liquid in a food processor or blender. Continue to add
liquid until the food becomes thin enough to sip through a straw.
Add liquids such as juice, milk, cream, broth, gravy, or vegetable juice to help add flavor to foods.
Heat foods after they have been blended, not before. This reduces the amount of foam created from blending.
If you need to increase calories in food:
Add protein powder or powdered milk to foods.
Cook with fats, such as margarine (without trans fat), sour cream, cream cheese, cream, or nut butters.
Prepare foods with sweeteners, such as honey, ice cream, blackstrap molasses, or sugar.
Meal planning
Eat at least three meals and three snacks daily. It is important to make sure that you get enough calories and protein
to prevent weight loss and help your body heal, especially after surgery.
Eat a variety of foods from each food group every day, including fruits and vegetables, protein, whole grains, dairy,
and healthy fats.
If your teeth and mouth are sensitive to extreme temperatures, heat or cool your foods to lukewarm temperatures.
What foods are recommended?
The items listed may not be a complete list. Talk with your dietitian about what dietary choices are best for you.
