Law Dept. File No: 2021-023707
Dear Counselor:
We write to request that you provide us with certain personal identifying information
about each plaintiff you represent in this lawsuit in order for us to determine whether they are a
Medicare recipient(s). Specifically, we need each plaintiff's date of birth, gender, and Social
Security number or Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN), also known as the Medicare
number. This information will be used by the Law Department to obtain plaintiff's Medicare
status via a database established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") for
this purpose. 1
Information about a plaintiff's Medicare status is required by the City in order to comply
with federal Medicare laws. Self-insured liability entities (such as the City of New York) are
considered "primary plans" under the Medicare laws and are, therefore, required to report to
1
CMS has developed a "query process" under which a responsible reporting entity (RRE) (such as the City in this
case) can determine a claimant's Medicare status electronically, as long as the RRE has access to the claimant's
name, date of birth, gender and social security number. Seger V. Tank Connection, LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
49013 at *13 (D. Neb. Apr. 22, 2010).

CMS all monetary recoveries obtained by Medicare-eligible plaintiffs in personal injury lawsuits.
See Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA) 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(8)(A)(i); Seger V. Tank
Connection, LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49013 (D. Neb. Apr. 22, 2010) ) ("the Extension Act
adds new mandatory reporting obligations to the Medicare Secondary Payer Act ("MSPA")
requiring
self-insurers to provide detailed information regarding all liability settlements or
open claims with ongoing responsibility for medical treatment with Medicare beneficiaries to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS")"). Torres V Visto Realty Corp., 2015 N.Y.
App. Div. LEXIS 3216, 1-2 (1st Dep't 2015) ("plaintiff did not satisfy his obligations under
CPLR 5003-a, since he failed to provide defendant with the information relating to his Medicare
status that defendant requires to comply with its reporting obligations under 42 USC ยง 1395y")
(citations omitted); Bey V. City of New York, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15597, at *5-6 (E.D.N.Y.
Feb. 5, 2013) (same.). Thus, the City needs to ascertain plaintiff's Medicare status for the
purposes of satisfying its reporting obligations.
Additionally, the City also requires the personal identifying information to resolve any
outstanding Medicare claims before issuing payment on settlements. See MSPA, 42 U.S.C.
1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii) ("a primary plan's responsibility for such payment may be demonstrated by a
judgment [or settlement
for items or services included in a claim against the primary plan
."); see also Torres V. Hirsch Park, LLC, 91 AD.3d 942 (2nd Dep't 2012) ("the authorizations
that the Supreme Court directed the plaintiff to provide are necessary for the defendant to
comply with its statutory duty to report the identity of a claimant who is entitled to Medicare
benefits (see 42 USC 1395y[b][8]) and to determine the existence of potential subrogation claims
[under federal law]") (citations omitted); Liss V. Brigham Park Coop Apts., 264 A.D.2d 717 (2d
Dep't 1999) (because the Federal government has a right of action directly against the defendant
for recovery of its lien, it was "incumbent upon plaintiff to resolve the lien and give the
defendant a release.")
Indeed, the responsibility of assuring reimbursement of Medicare claims extends to all
entities involved in the underlying liability action, including the plaintiff's counsel. CFR ยง
411.24(g); United States V. Harris, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23956 (N.D. W. Va. Mar. 26, 2009)
(holding that plaintiff's attorney is liable to Medicare for unpaid liens because he disbursed
settlement funds in a liability case to his client without first reimbursing Medicare for its claims).
Thus, it is to all parties' benefit to ascertain a plaintiff's Medicare status as early as possible SO as
to resolve any existing Medicare claims and facilitate payment of settlements.
In view of the foregoing, we ask that you promptly submit to us the requested
information. If you know for a fact that your client presently receives Medicare, you should
immediately (1) notify Medicare of the pending lawsuit;2 (2) provide the Law Department with

If you have never notified Medicare about this injury claim before, the first step is to report the injury to the
Benefits Coordination & Recovery Contractor (BCRC) at P.O. Box 138897, Oklahoma City, OK 73113-8897, or by
telephone at 1-855-798-2627. A case identifier will be established, and you will then receive a correspondence
from the BCRC concerning any conditional payments made by Medicare on your client's behalf for the injuries
underlying this case. BCRC is the agency that will issue final demand letters on amounts due Medicare. More

plaintiff's Medicare identification number and/or social security number; (3) obtain conditional
and final payment information from Medicare and (4) provide copies of any correspondences to
the City. If future medical care for plaintiff is anticipated, you may also need to consider a
Medicare set-aside instrument for payment of future medical costs;
3
If plaintiff was insured under a Medicare Advantage Plan ("MAP") under Part C of the
Medicare Act at any time after the incident at issue here, plaintiff should notify the City about
the MAP coverage, and also inform the MAP(s) of this lawsuit. Recent New York decisions
have held that a MAP provider can pursue recovery of its reimbursement and/or subrogation
claims in the same manner as traditional Medicare. See Potts V. Rawlings Co., LLC, 897 F.
Supp. 2d 185 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); Trezza V Trezza, 104 A.D.3d 37, 48 (2d Dep't 2012)
("Based on the express preemption provision set forth in 42 USC ยง 1395w-26(b)(3), as well as
the regulations set forth in 42 CFR 422.108(f), we hold that General Obligations Law ยง 5-335,
insofar as applied to Medicare Advantage organizations under Part C, is preempted by federal
law since it would impermissibly constrain contractual reimbursement rights authorized under
the "Organization as secondary payer" provisions of the Medicare Act."). Moreover, several
federal courts have ruled that a MAP provider can also bring a federal action to collect on its
liens under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395y(b)(3)(A) - and can seek double damages thereunder. See In re
Avandia Mktg., 685 F.3d 353, 360 (3d Cir. Pa. 2012); Collins V. Wellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc.,
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174420 (E.D. La. Dec. 16, 2014). The City, therefore, will require
resolution of any Medicare-related claims as a condition to any settlement in this matter,
regardless whether the claims are asserted by the government under a traditional Medicare plan
or by a MAP under a Medicare Part C.
Thank you for your attention to the foregoing. Should you have any questions, feel free
to contact the City's Medicare Compliance Unit at medicare@law.nyc.gov.
PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE CANNOT FINALIZE ANY SETTLEMENT
WITH A CURRENT MEDICARE RECIPIENT WITHOUT FIRST RESOLVING
MEDICARE'S CLAIM.
Very truly yours,
Medicare Compliance Officer
Encl.
3 You should be aware that if CMS determines that Medicare's future interests were not adequately protected, CMS
may require that plaintiff expend up to the entire amount of the settlement on Medicare-covered expenses related to
the injury claimed in this lawsuit before Medicare will provide coverage for the further treatment of such injury. See
Cribb V. Sulzer Metco (US) Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134900 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 5, 2012); Sipler V. Trans Am
Trucking, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 635, 638 (D.N.J. 2012). Accordingly, we suggest that plaintiff evaluate her future
medical needs with her physicians and consider creating a Medicare set-aside instrument at the appropriate time.

9.
At all times mentioned in the complaint, plaintiff(s) knew or should have
known in the exercise of due/reasonable care of the risks and dangers incident to engaging in the
activity alleged. Plaintiff(s) voluntarily performed and engaged in the alleged activity and
assumed the risk of the injuries and/or damages claimed. Plaintiff(s) failed to use all required,
proper, appropriate and reasonable safety devices and/or equipment and failed to take all proper,
appropriate and reasonable steps to assure his/her/their safety. Plaintiff(s)' primary assumption
of risk solely caused his/her/their injuries and/or damage and defendant(s) owed no duty to the
plaintiff(s) with respect to the risk assumed. Plaintiff(s)' express assumption of risk solely
caused his/her/their injuries and/or damage and defendant(s) owed no duty to the plaintiff(s) with
respect to the risk assumed. Plaintiff(s)' implied assumption of risk caused or contributed, in
whole or in part to his/her/their injuries. In any action for injuries arising from the use of a

damages sustained were caused by the failure of the plaintiff(s) to use available seat-belts and/or
other safety devices.

The amounts recoverable by plaintiff(s) are subject to limitation pursuant
to Section 1601 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, by reason of the culpable conduct of other
person(s) who are, or with reasonable diligence could have been made party defendant(s) to this
action, or pursuant to Section 15-108 of the General Obligations Law, by reason of a prior
settlement between plaintiff(s) and said person(s), or pursuant to Section 4545 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules are subject to reduction by collateral sources received by plaintiff(s), or
by reason of the fact that punitive damages are not recoverable against municipal defendant(s).
12.
If plaintiff demonstrates that the acts complained of were undertaken in
the scope of the actor(s) employment, then such acts as may have been committed by law
enforcement officers in the employ of the City of New York were justified as being reasonably
necessary, and were committed in good faith without malice and with probable cause, and in the
exercise of professional judgment or the performance of discretionary functions for which
defendant(s) are qualifiedly privileged under the laws of this State and of the United States.
Individual defendant(s) represented by the Office of the Corporation Counsel (if any) did not
