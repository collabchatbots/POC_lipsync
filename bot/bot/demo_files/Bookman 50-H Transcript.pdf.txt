Good afternoon, Mr. Bookman. My name

questions today about an incident or incidents

that occurred while you were in custody at Rikers
19
Island, the injuries that you sustained and a

little bit about your background. You will give
21
answers to those questions to the best your
22
ability.

way, if you have a problem with the connection,

At the time of the incident you were in

custody,

4
A
Yes.
5
Q
Were you serving a sentence or pending
6
a criminal case or something else?
7
A
I was, you know, I was un-sentenced.
I
8
was not sentenced. I was a detainee.
9
Q
Where were you being held as a
10
detainee?
11
A
On Rikers Island. On that day of the
12
incident, C-74. I believe it was RNDC, but they
13
changed the name. That is the Four Building.
14
Q
Let's start off with the criminal case
15
that you were a detainee, has that case been
16
resolved?
17
A
No. .
18
Q
I am sorry?
19
A
No.
20
Q
Is it still pending?

A
Yes.
22
Q
Do you remember approximately when you
23
got arrested on those charges?
24
A
June 2020.
25
Q
From the date of the arrest were you
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
13
1
David Bookman
2
held in custody straight away from the
3
arraignment?
4
A
From when?
5
Q
You got arrested in June of 2020,
6
correct?
7
A
Yes.
8
Q
They process you through some county
9
central booking, correct?
10
A
Right.
11
Q
Then after seeing the judge either in
12 person or probably virtually, were you released or
13
remanded into custody?
14
A
I was in custody.
15
Q
When did you get released?
16
A
I got released a couple of months ago,
17
about two months ago, November '21.
18
Q
The housing unit at the Four Building,
19
was it a dormitory --
20
A
Yes.
21
Q
Dormitory?
22
A
Cells.
23
Q
Before the incident where you hurt your
24
jaw, how long were you in that housing unit?
25
A
Maybe a day or two, if that. Maybe a
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
14
1
David Bookman
2
couple. Not too long. Not too long.
3
Q
Let's say a few days before, were you
4
in a different housing unit somewhere else on
5
Rikers Island?
6
A
Yes.
7
Q
To your understanding or to what you
8
might know, the transfer to this building at Four
9
Building, do you know what the reason was or was
10 it just a routine transfer because they needed the
11 space? Do you have any idea why you got
12 transferred?
13
A
Well, to be honest with you, at the
14
time Rikers is a very dangerous and I was high
15 classification. So at that time they would just
16
randomly move you for numerous reasons.
17
Like they will move you because they
18
have to accommodate a lot of gang people too. So
19
the fact that I am neutral, they might have needed
20 my cell for a swap for somebody else coming from a
21 different building. So that is what they usually
22
do.
23
Q
So it was not as a result of an
24
incident that you got moved.
25
A
Well, to be honest with you, everything
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
15
1
David Bookman
2
is an incident on Rikers Island when you are in
3
there. There is nothing that is not an incident.
4
Your constantly involved in incidents all the
5 time.
6
MR. HINES: He is asking if you were
7
moved for some sort of disciplinary reason.
8
Right, is that the basis of your
9
question?
10
MR. BILLIG: Yes.
11
Q
Within a week before this incident,
12
were you involved in another incident which
13
required them to transfer you?
14
A
No.
15
MR. HINES: That you are aware.
16
MR. BILLIG: Yes.
17
Q
To your understanding, at Rikers Island
18
do they have you assigned as gang affiliated?
19
A
Not that I know of, no. They
20 shouldn't.
21
Q
But I think you mentioned, and I want
22
to use the right word, SO you indicated that you
23
believe that you were classified as a high level
24
classification.
25
A
Yes, of course. That is due to your
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
16
1
David Bookman
2
charges and your history. You automatically
3
become high classification?
4
Q
Do you know which specific housing unit
5
within the Four Building you were assigned to?
6
A
Well, for one I was assigned to
7
numerous housing units, but on the day of the
8
particular incident I was in, I believe it was in
9
the lower. I think it was 1 Lower.
10
Q
The notice of claim that was filed
11
indicates 2 Lower. Does that refresh your
12
recollection?
13
A
Yes. Yes, that could be it, 2 Lower.
14
Q
When you arrived at that housing unit,
15
did you know anyone in the housing unit from
16
either prior occasions at Rikers Island or from
17
the outside?
18
A
No.
19
Q
You were only in that housing unit for
20
a day or two before this incident began, correct?
21
A
Yes, a week tops I would say.
22
Q
Let's go with a week at the most.
23
During that time period before in this incident
24
occurred, did you have any altercations, problems
25
with any of detainees during the time period
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
17
1
David Bookman
2
before this incident?
3
A
May I ask you a question? Basically,
4
what you are asking me is, do any of the prior
5
incidents have do with this incident? Is that
6
what your asking me.
7
Q
What I am asking you is, for the time
8
period you were in that housing unit, which could
9
be one or two days or a week at most, did you have
10
any incidents or altercations with any other
11
detainees during that time period?
12
A
No. The time I was in that house, I
13
didn't have no altercations, but with that
14 incident.
15
Q
That is what I am asking. I am not
16 asking about other times in different places in
17
the building.
18
A
Okay, no. Because, all right, when I
19
was in that housing unit that day, that was the
20 only time that day. Not any other incidents I
21 ever had before that. Before that was isolated.
22
It had nothing to do with that. So no problems
23
that I ever had in my past or any disagreements or
24
anything that I ever had, had to do with that
25 incident that day.

David Bookman
2
Q
About what time of day did the incident
3
begin?
4
A
I am going to be honest with you,
5
because, you know, when you in there, you are
6 inside. So the lighting is like you have no light
7 never. So I would say, it could have been, to me
8
at that time it felt like the afternoon, mid
9 evening. So I will say anywhere between 4:00,
10
5:00, SO maybe 6:00, 7:00 in the evening.
11
Q
Where within the housing unit were you
12
located when the incident began?
13
A
The dayroom and on the tier to the
14
cell, back to the tier.
15
Q
So were you on the tier or the hallway
16
leading back to your cell or were you in the
17
dayroom when it began?
18
A
The incident began in the dayroom.
19
Q
So let's S start off with five minutes
20
before the incident, were you in the dayroom?
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
What were you doing in the dayroom
23
before the incident began?
24
A
Watching I believe Chicago P.D., ,
25
watching Chicago P.D.

David Bookman
2
Q
Were you seated? Were you sitting
3
down?
4
A
Yes.
5
Q
Did something happen while you were
6
still seated watching TV?
7
A
Not at that time.
8
Q
How did the incident first begin?
9
A
One of the wardens, one of the
10
assistant wardens, the deputy warden, he wanted a
11
security team, a CO was doing a security walk.
12
Prior to them doing a walk, they had been moving
13
different gang members and numerous people in and
14
out of the housing unit the last day or two.
15
They, you know, just take out six bodies and move
16
in six more bodies.
17
So, when they came in, basically they
18
had just reopened that house. It was like a new
19 housing unit. We was complaining about the
20
conditions and, you know, utensils and things we
21
was entitled to that we did not have.
22
When she came in, we all, everybody in
23
the dayroom and down the tier and in their cells
24
came out to talk to them. When I went back in the
25
dayroom to sit down to continue watching TV and
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
20

David Bookman
2
waiting for them to maybe walk around and come
3
back. You know, I was giving her a chance to walk
4 around. Maybe she'll come back and talk to me
5
again.
6
So I went to sit down, because, you
7
know, I am not doing too good, physically. When
I
8
went to sit down and watch TV, a guy just walked
9
up and snatched the remote control like from right
10
in front of me. Then when I went to look to see
11
what arm was it, he just punched me in my mouth.
12
Q
Were you holding the remote?
13
A
No, not at the time. I was not holding
14
it.
15
Q
Was the remote right next to you?
16
A
Yes, it was right next to me.
17
So when I went to observe him taking
18
the remote, I just wanted to look to see who was
19
reaching by me, you know. So when I went to look,
20
he swung and busted my lip.
21
Q
Was that a detainee?
22
A
Yes, that was a detainee.
23
When he did that - -
24
Q
Hold on. Hold on.
25
Do you know his name?

A
No, not offhand.
3
Q
Did he give you any indication that he
4
was
going
to punch you?
5
A
No, not at all.
6
Q
That initial punch, did he land it?
7
A
Yes, he busted my lip.
8
Q
After that initial punch, did the two
9
of you start fighting?
10
A
No, what he did was, he kind of like,
11
he went to flash me. Like he flashed me a
12
homemade knife and he ran. He ran, because when
13
he ran out of the dayroom, the dep and the
14
security officer was walking down the tier So
15
when he ran
16
Q
So he struck you one time and then ran
17 out the room, basically.
18
A
Yes.
19
Q
Were you bleeding at that point?
20
MR. HINES: After flashing him the
21
weapon or the knife.
22
A
Yes, I had a little busted lip. I had
23
blood in my mouth. So you could see that I was
24
bleeding, yes.
25
Q
Did you see that he had a weapon in my
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
22
1
David Bookman
2
hand?
3
A
Yes, absolutely.
4
Q
Could you identify what the weapon
5
looked like?
6
A
Like a knife. Like a little knife.
7
It's a jail knife. Like a jail knife. Like some
8
Plexiglass something, screw. It was something.
9
Q
So at that point what did you decide to
10
do?
11
A
When he punched me and pulled out the
12
knife, I decide to walk towards him, you know.
I
13
was actually upset, and as I was walking towards
14
him.
15
Q
Is this now out on the tier?
16
A
Yes. So as I get him, basically as I
17
am walking him, as I am walking towards him and
I
18
am trying to like, you know, trying to defend
19
myself or whatever or stand tall.
20
Q
Let me ask this, at that point was the
21
first thing that you did go to report it to a CO
22
or was it to confront him?
23
A
When he swung at me, it was to swing
24
back, but I couldn't.
25
Q
He ran out of the room and left you in
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
23
1
David Bookman
2
the room, correct?
3
A
No, listen, listen.
4
Q
No, answer my question. You said --
5
A
That is not correct.
6
Q
You said that after he hit you, he
7
flashed you the weapon and ran out of the room,
8
correct?
9
A
Yes, because when he swung at me and I
10
went to swing on him, he flashed me the weapon and
11
he leased out the dayroom, but I am still walking
12
behind him the whole entire time.
13
Q
After you were initially struck you
14
swung back at him correct?
15
A
No, I couldn' t swing at him, because he
16
flashed the knife.
17
Q
Did you take a swing at him?
18
A
No, I couldn't.
19
Q
So he had the knife and you followed
20
him out of the dayroom.
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
Was that to go report it or to confront
23
him?
24
A
Yes.
25
Q
Which one, to confront him?
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
24
1
David Bookman
2
A
Yes, I was trying to confront him, but
3
I also wanted to get out of the dayroom too. Do
4
you understand?
5
Q
Now, what happened after you got out
6
onto the tier?
7
A
He runs by the dep and the security CO.
8
I tell the dep. I said, look he just punched me,
9
you know. He just assaulted me, because I had
10
blood in my mouth. She was like, oh, WOW. What
11
is going on? I am like, yo, he just swung at me.
12
The security officer, he basically
13
looked at me and he looked down the hall. And to
14
me, I kept telling him, yo, this guy just swung at
15 me. Let me go. Let me get something. It was
16 busted. So I was starting to bleed.
17
So I don't remember if someone gave me
18
a tissue or if I went in my cell. I think I went
19 in the cell and tried to get some tissues. They
20 ended up walking me. The dep was like, let's walk
21
up the tier. I can't leave you in the cell like
22 this. I am like I am not staying here. This guy
23
just, you know, attacked me and put a knife on me.
24
So when I went back, as we walked
25 toward the dayroom, the security officer was kind
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
25
1
David Bookman
2
of mocking me and laughing at me that I had got
3
punched. He was telling me to do what I've got to
4 do.
5
I am like, man, I can't. I said that I
6
could barely walk, because I had a cane, you know,
7
due to my injuries and me being shot already.
I
8 was like I am already physically, you know, beat
9
up, man. I can't be tussling nobody, man.
10
I am like I don't even know what
11
happened. You are bringing people in here that
12
just come in here swinging at people. I felt like
13 he was picking on me because I was the only one
14
walking with a cane. I was not supposed to be in
15
that housing unit.
16
So when he did that and I said that to
17 him, I guess the officer got mad that I explained
18 to him that I was not supposed to be there and I
19 needed medical attention.
20
So what he did was, he closed the
21
dayroom door and him and the deputy warden, they
22 walked out. When they walked out, I just remember
23 me going in my cell and, you know, me telling
24 another guy in the house that I seen that had been
25 in the house for a couple of days, you know. I
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
26
1
David Bookman
2
was just saying, yo, this is messed up. You know,
3
this dude just swung at me like this.
4
So, I ended up going past one of the
5
empty cells to get like another rag or something
6
to put on my mouth and grab a book. Then when I
7
went in that cell, one of the other guys attacked
8
me again.
9
Q
Is this a different guy?
10
A
Yes. So, now, while they are attacking
11
me, I am fighting them. They all come in the
12 cell. It's like three of them. So, as the guys
13 come in the cell, all I remember is me, you know,
14 they beat me up and stuff and swinging on me.
15
All I remember is me trying to slide
16 out. I just remember I don't know. Well, to
17 me it felt like being hit with a brick, but all I
18 remember is the CO like just swinging on me and
19
hitting me and connecting with the side of my
20
face.
21
Q
So you are claiming that the CO struck
22
you.
23
A
Yes, he struck me too, definitely.
24
Q
Do you know the CO's name?
25
A
The reason why I don't know the CO's
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
27
1
David Bookman
2
name off the top of my head is because he was not
3
a steady. He was not like a steady officer. He
4
was a substitute CO for that day.
5
Q
Can you give me a physical description
6
of him. Let's start with his height and weight?
7
A
I would say brown skin, about maybe one
8
fifty, about five seven, five eight, about five
9
nine. I will say about five eight, five nine, low
10
haircut, light eyes. He is like a black Hispanic.
11
He is like Dominican, but black.
12
Q
So this interaction or this melee,
13
about how long did it last?
14
A
I would say about a good five minutes,
15
ten minutes tops.
16
Q
How did it come to an end?
17
A
Because what happened was, one of the
18
guys, one of the COs started pushing a guy. And
19 one of the other guys, he actually like had a
20
knife. I guess, I don't know. I guess, I just
21
walked back. I just backed myself up and I walked
22
back out. So as one of the guys was coming toward
23
me, I just walked back.
24
Q
You were able to get yourself out of
25 the situation before
516-485-2222

2
A
Yes.
3
Q
Was the emergency response unit called
4
or the Turtles called?
5
A
Yes, after. They eventually came.
6
They eventually came and then when they came, they
7 took just me to intake. They did not take me
8
straight to the clinic.
9
Q
Okay, hold on.
10
Now in connection with this incident,
11
were you issued a disciplinary ticket?
12
A
No.
13
Q

that?

Q
From intake were you brought to the
18
clinic?
19

I don't know. Maybe an hour, hour and
20 a half, maybe two.
21
Q
Then you were brought to the medical
22
clinic?
23
A
Yes. Then in the medical clinic --
24

about?

5
Q
What did you complain about that was
6
hurt?
7
A
My jaw, my head, my back, but my jaw,
8
my face. It looked like I got hit by a Mac truck.
9
My face was out.
10
Q
From a medical point of view, what did
11
they do for you at the clinic, if anything?
12
A
The doctor looked at me. He told me my
13 jaw was broken and he said I needed to go to
14 urgent care. Then he looked at his watch and
15
said, hey, you can't go to urgent care tonight and
16
I don't know what to do. He got on the phone for
17
about like an hour or two and that was it.
18
I had to wait until the next day to go
19
to urgent care. Rikers, they didn't want to let,
20 they said they didn't have enough staff for
21 somebody to take me to the emergency room or to
22
call the ambulance. So I had to wait will until
23 the next day to change the tour for me to go to
24
urgent care. Then I went to urgent care.
25
Q
Hold on.

10
A
Upper.
11
Q
When they told you at the hospital at
12
Rikers Island that you had a fractured jaw, did
13
they then treat it there or did they have you
14
brought to an outside facility?
15
A
They immediately, once the doctor did
16
that, they immediately transported me to Bellevue
17
Hospital.
18
Q
About how long during is that stay did
19
they keep you at Bellevue?
20

Island for follow ups to the doctor at Bellevue
3
Hospital?
4
A
No. They were supposed to, but they
5
wouldn't and they wasn't because they were short
6
of staff.
7
So like right now I am supposed to go
8
and get the metal out of my mouth. I was
9
complaining to them and until this day, I still I
10
have the metal in my mouth.
11
Q
I am going to get to that.
12
Let's first start off with the wire.
13
At some point it got removed, correct?
14
A
Yes, the rubber bands. It's not wires.
15
They put the wires. The wires stay in your mouth.
16
It's the rubber bands.

The rubber bands are what keep your
18
mouth enclosed, correct?

22
you, you know, I just wanted to get this out of my
23
mouth.
24
Q
What hospital?
25
A
I went to Presbyterian, 168. What they
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
36
1
David Bookman
2
did was, they told me they recommended me to go
3
where they put it in my mouth. They wanted me
to
4
go back to Bellevue.
5
They had gave me a number and stated,
6
you know, if I could not get in contact with
7
Bellevue to call I guess their hotline and they
8
will try to take it out from me.
9
What I ended up doing is, I ended up
10 going to my primary care doctor and just get a
11 check up, you know, check my blood and pressure
12 and stuff. I told him what was going on with my
13
face and he gave me, he had gave me the number to
14
Bellevue where they did it at.
15
Because, you know, this happened when
I
16
was in jail. So when I called, I have to actually
17 go in this week, this Wednesday.
18
Q
So do you have an appointment in two
19
days?
20
A
Yes. They didn't really want to give
21
an actual appointment, because they felt like they
22
didn't want to get in trouble, but the actual
23 surgeon people that is going to do it, will be in
24
Wednesday. So they were scared. They said it
25 should have been taken out of face, out of my
