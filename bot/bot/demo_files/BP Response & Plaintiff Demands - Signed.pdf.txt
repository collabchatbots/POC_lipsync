Plaintiff, by his attorneys, HELD & HINES, LLP, responding to Defendant, THE CITY
OF NEW YORK'S demand for a Verified Bill of Particulars, herein alleges as follows:
1.
The occurrence took place on June 7, 2021, between the hours of 3:00 P.M. to 8:00
P.M.
2.
The occurrence took place in 2 Lower South, in the dayroom, at the Robert N.
Davoren Complex facility in Rikers Island.
3.
Plaintiff David Bookman was caused to suffer the following injuries:
(a) Fractured jaw.
(b) Three (3) teeth removed.
(c) Open reduction internal fixation.
(d) Plaintiff's jaw remained wired shut.
4.
All injuries are claimed to be permanent except those of a superficial nature. See
also No. 3 above. Plaintiff will only make a partial recovery due to the trauma to the injured area
and these will be left with permanent weakness and will become pre-disposed to exacerbation and
remissions under the slightest provocation of stress. In addition, early degenerative changes will
form as a result of the traumatic effects.
The above injuries have caused Plaintiff to suffer pain at and around the sites of the above
injuries. The above injuries have affected the full, free, and normal use and function of the regions
described and above and have residual conditions, which are persistent and permanent, except for
those injuries of a superficial nature. Plaintiff will claim each and every condition and injury set
forth in the medical records and reports exchanged pursuant to the CPLR and Court rules.
If it is proven at trial by Defendants that Plaintiff suffered any prior injury, disease, or
condition to any portion of the body claimed injured herein, then it is hereby claimed that said
injury, disease of condition was aggravated and/or accelerated and/or exacerbated and/or
precipitated by the within accident. Plaintiff does not at this time allege that Plaintiff suffered an
aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation, and/or precipitation of any prior injury, disease, or
condition to any portion of the body claimed injured herein.
Said injuries have directly and indirectly adversely effected the nerves, tissues, blood
vessels, blood supply, muscles, ligaments, cartilage's tendons, bones, and soft parts in and about
the sites of the above-described areas of injury, including the central nervous system, muscular
system, skeletal and digestive system. Plaintiff has required and will continue to require for an
indefinite period of further duration (in all probability permanently) continuous medical care,
medications, and various modalities of therapy.
Plaintiff further suffered and suffers from associated and concomitant impairments and
negative effects upon Plaintiff's pre-accident enjoyment of life, day to day existence, activities,
vocation, avocation and all other activities in which Plaintiff engaged prior to the underlying
accident; pre-accident modus vivendi and inability to resume all pre-accident social relations,
contracts and participation as well as suffering associated pains, disabilities, limitations of
functions and activities; the injuries, manifestations and sequelae are permanent and chronic;
additionally, with advancing years there will be naturally and medically related complications and
exacerbations. The aforesaid have and will continue in the future to affect every facet of Plaintiff's
pre-accident lifestyle with resultant damages. Plaintiff to his detriment will continue to sustain
permanent loss of impairment of his physical and mental health.
5.
(a) Plaintiff was confined to the hospital for four (4) days following the subject
occurrence.
(b) Plaintiff was confined to his bed for approximately five (5) days following the
subject occurrence.
(c) Not applicable.
6.
(a-e) Plaintiff is not presently aware of any out-of-pocket expenses.
7.
See response to item "6".
8.
(a-e) Not applicable. Plaintiff was not employed at the time of the incident.
9.
(a-b) Not applicable. Plaintiff was not enrolled in school at the time of the incident.
10.
Plaintiff resides at 241 W. 101st Street, Apt # 1C, New York, New York 10025.
11.
Plaintiff is not known by any other names.
12.
Plaintiff's date of birth is March 15, 1985. Objection. As disclosing Plaintiff's
Social Security Number in the course of litigation necessarily makes that information public, it is
impermissible pursuant to General Business Law 899-aa, 5 U.S.C. § 556(b)(6) and the Federal
Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579) §7. To do SO has been held to be an unwanted invasion
of privacy. Seelig V. Sielaff, 201 A.D.2d 298, 299 (1st Dep't 1994); Kupferberg V. State, 97 Misc.
2d 519, 522, 411 N.Y.S.2d 790, 793 (Ct. of Claims 1978); Bibeau V. Cantiague Figure Skating
Club, Inc., 294 A.D.2d 525 (2d Dep't 2002). Further, 22 NYCRR § 202.5(e)(1)(i), GBL § 399-
ddd, and Public Officers Law § 96-a prohibit the disclosure of any document bearing a person's
social security number that may become subject to review by the general public. Given the
significant privacy concerns against disclosing Plaintiff's social security number, the fact that this
request appears to be an attempt to harass and reveal Plaintiff's private information, and the lack
of relevance of such request, this is patently improper, and Plaintiff's social security number is not
provided.
13.
(a-b) Not applicable. Plaintiff is not a recipient.
14.
(a-c) Not applicable. Plaintiff is not a recipient.
15.
Not applicable.
16.
Plaintiff objects to this demand, which calls for an evidentiary response, and which
is patently improper in every conceivable way. Plaintiff further objects to this demand as vague
and ambiguous, as there is no time or subject matter limitation, and it is not clear what Defendant
means by "crime." Accordingly, Plaintiff construes this request as seeking evidence of convictions
of felony crimes within the last 10 years. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection,
limitation, and construction, Plaintiff answers: (a)-(d): not applicable.
17.
(a-c) Not applicable.
18.
Not applicable.
19.
(a-i) Not applicable. Property damage is not being claimed.
20.
See response to item "2" above.
21.
Defendant City was negligent in its hiring, training, retention, supervision,
direction, control, appointment and/or promotion of its employees, agents and/or servants,
including but not limited to the defendant staff.
The failure of defendant City to adequately train its employees, agents and/or servants,
including but not limited to the defendant staff, in the exercise of their employment functions, and
their failure to enforce the United States Constitution, the laws of the State of New York, and the
rules and regulations of the City of New York, is evidence of the reckless lack of cautious regard
for the rights of those persons in their custody, including the plaintiff herein, and
exhibited a lack of that degree of due care which prudent and reasonable individuals would show.
Defendant City was careless and reckless in hiring, appointing, retaining and promoting
their employees, agents and/or servants, including but not limited to the defendant staff, in that
said employees lacked the experience and ability to be employed by the City; in failing to exercise
due care and caution in their hiring, appointment and promotion practices, and in particular, hiring
the defendant-employees who lacked the mental capacity and ability to function
as employees of said defendants; in that the defendant-employees lacked the maturity, sensibility
and intelligence to be employed by said defendants; in that said defendants knew of the lack of
ability, experience and maturity of the defendant-employees when they hired them to be an
employee; in that said defendants, their agents, servants and/or employees, failed to suspend and/or
terminate the defendant-employee(s) when such action was either proper or required; and in being
otherwise careless, negligent and reckless in the instance.
Defendant City knew or should have known in the exercise of reasonable care, the
propensities of the defendant staff to engage in the wrongful conduct heretofore alleged in this
Complaint.
The aforesaid acts and omissions of defendant City, its employees, agents and/or servants,
including but not limited to the defendant staff, resulted in the plaintiff being assaulted by inmates
and a correction officer and his civil rights being violated.
As set forth above, the defendants were negligent in their ownership, operation,
supervision, enforcement, and control of the Robert N. Davoren Complex where the assaults
occurred; in failing to supervise and control the detainees/inmates in reasonably and adequately
their custody and control, including but not limited to the plaintiff and his assailants; in failing to
protect the health and welfare of the plaintiff; in failing to provide the plaintiff with reasonably
safe living conditions while he was confined to their custody and control; in negligent supervision
of the plaintiff and his assailants; in failing to quickly and diligently intercede in the subject attacks
on Plaintiff; in setting a trap for the plaintiff; in failing to take cognizance of a dangerous and
escalating situation; in failing to have an adequate policy to curtail inmate-on-inmate violence; in
failing to take reasonable measures and precautions to avoid and/or mitigate the incidence of
inmate-on-inmate violence; in violating the plaintiff's civil, statutory and common law rights; in
infringing upon the freedoms afforded to the plaintiff; in being deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's
health, safety, and security; in causing and allowing their jails to be and remain violent and
dangerous for those imprisoned therein; in causing, creating and/or allowing unlawful jail
conditions to be and remain; in having a policy, either written or by custom, which accepts and/or
promotes inmate-on-inmate violence; in having a policy, either written or by custom, which
accepts and/or promotes correction officer disinterest, indifference and/or un-involvement during
incidents of inmate-on-inmate violence; in failing to timely prevent and/or mitigate the subject
incidents despite having notice, time and opportunity to do so; in failing to reasonably and
adequately discipline and/or segregate plaintiff and his assailants following prior violent incidents
and/or other disciplinary violations; in permitting violent prisoners to be left unattended and
unsupervised; in permitting gang member to fraternize and scheme violence; in failing to inspect
and supervise the locations of the subject incidents after notice was given; in failing to give the
plaintiff notice and/or warning; in causing and/or allowing the plaintiff to be injured; in causing
and creating a dangerous condition conducive to causing injury; in causing and creating a
dangerous and hazardous condition to exist; in creating and allowing a nuisance to exist; in failing
to provide for the safety of the plaintiff; in failing to adequately train the correction officers charged
with maintaining security of the subject locations and control of plaintiff and his assailants; in
failing to have trained personnel; that the above stated occurrences would not have occurred but
for the negligence of the defendants; in causing, permitting and/or allowing the plaintiff to be
assaulted and battered; and said defendants were otherwise negligent, careless and reckless in the
instance.
22.
Not applicable. Plaintiff is not making a claim for intentional wrongs.
23.
Plaintiff objects to this demand because the information requested in within the sole
and exclusive possession of the Defendant; see also Response to Items 2 and 21.

were violated; Defendant is not entitled to a statement of laws. Defendants are not entitled to
particulars as to the statutes, ordinances, etc. claimed to have been violated in as much as the trial
court is required to take judicial notice of same where pleaded and proven. With respect to the

will ask the Court to take judicial notice of all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, and laws-
including without limitation, all statutes, ordinances rules, laws and regulations governing or
applicable to the ownership, management, maintenance repair, and control of real property, public
property, and parks (including specifically property owned, managed, maintained, repaired, or

Plaintiff, by his attorneys, HELD & HINES, LLP, responding to Defendants', Demand
for Discovery, and Inspection, herein alleges as follows:
GENERAL STATEMENT
By making the information and/or documents available to Defendant in this action in
response to Defendant's Document Request, the Plaintiff do not waive, and do not intend to waive,
any objections that said Plaintiff may have regarding the use of the information and/or documents
or of the truth or accuracy of any characterization contained therein.
Plaintiff expressly reserves: (1) all objections regarding the competency, privilege,
relevance, materiality and admissibility of all information and/or documents produced and the
contents thereof; (2) the right to object to the use of any document(s) produced, in whole or in part,
or to the subject matter covered thereby in any later stage or proceeding in this litigation or any
other proceeding on any or all grounds set forth herein; (3) the right to object on any and all proper
grounds, at any time, to other discovery procedures involving or relating to the subject matter of
any document or information produced by said Defendant; and (4) all objections as to vagueness
and ambiguity. Furthermore, where a Document request seeks to impose on said Plaintiff
obligations broader than those imposed by the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, said
Plaintiff shall respond in conformance with the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. Privileged
documents responsive to a particular Document Request, if any such documents exist, are not
being produced, and will be identified consistent with the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.
Plaintiff has been assisted in the preparation of responses and objections to the Defendants'
Document Requests by counsel. Accordingly, the word usage and sentence structure of said
Plaintiff responses and objections may be that of the individual attorney who assisted in their
preparation, and no representation is made that these objections and responses contain the precise
language of the executing party. Said Plaintiff responses are based upon information and
documents known to said Plaintiff and/or said Plaintiff attorneys as of the date such responses are
served. Said Plaintiff will continue to review files, and accordingly, reserves the right to
supplement, amend or correct the responses and objections in the event that future discovery
reveals documents and/or information that would justify its supplementation, correction, and
amendment. Should said Plaintiff at any time amend or supplement the responses, by agreement
or otherwise, said Plaintiff reserve the right to assert any available privilege or objection with
respect to any information or documents which might otherwise be discoverable in connection
with any amendment or supplementation.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS:
Plaintiff submits the following General Objections, which apply to each and every one of
Defendant's Document Requests. These objections and limitations form a part of the response to
each, and every response set forth here to avoid the duplication and repetition of restating them for
each response. The assertion of the same, similar, or additional answers or responses in the specific
answers to Defendant's Documents Requests does not waive any of said Plaintiff General
Objections as set forth below:
1.
Plaintiff reserves the right to challenge the competency, relevance, and
admissibility, at trial or any subsequent proceeding, in this or any other action, or any statement
made, or information provided in response to Defendant's Document Requests.
2.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that is drafted in such a manner
that is overbroad.
3.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that is vague and/or
ambiguous, meaning that Plaintiff is unable to determine what information is requested SO as to
formulate a response in whole or in part.
4.
Plaintiff objects to each and every discovery request that purports to seek
information or data which is unduly burdensome and/or can be obtained from other documentation
and more readily available to the party propounding the document request without causing
unnecessary expense and hardship to Plaintiff.
5.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that is directed to or made on
behalf of entities or persons who are not parties to this litigation.
6.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that seeks information
or
documents not in its possession or control or to which Defendant's has equal access.
7.
Plaintiff objects to each and every request that seeks the discovery of information,
documents or data which is irrelevant, and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.
8.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that attempts to elicit protected
documents and/or information subject to the attorney-client privilege; the work product doctrine;
the confidentiality of documents containing the impressions, conclusions, opinions, legal research
or theories of Plaintiff or their attorneys; or which seek materials prepared in anticipation of
litigation. Plaintiff asserts each and every one of the foregoing privileges and protections
applicable to the information sought to the fullest extent provided by law or applicable rules and
future Orders by the Court herein.
9.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that makes or seeks a legal
conclusion.
10.
Plaintiff objects to each and every document request that seeks documents or
information not limited with respect to time and prior to and/or beyond the time period alleged in
the Complaint.
11.
Plaintiff objects to the extent each and every document request seeks to impose
allegations greater than that imposed by the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and any
applicable rules of Court.
12.
Plaintiff has based her objections and responses to these Document Requests on
information currently available to Plaintiff and reserves the right to amend objections and
responses to include information and documents which may be obtained through ongoing
discovery and investigation, in accordance with the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.
13.
The foregoing General Objections are incorporated by reference within each and
every of the following responses and objections. Responses to specific Document Requests are
made subject to and without waiving these General Objections, whether or not specifically
reiterated in the responses themselves.
14.
Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement, amend or correct their responses in the
event of the development or availability of additional, responsive, non-privileged information to
the extent such supplementation, correction or amendment is warranted, pursuant to the New York
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
RESPONSE TO DEMANDS:
1.
Not applicable.
2.
(a-e) Plaintiff is not aware of any witnesses other than himself.
3.
See response 2 above.
4.
See response 2 above.
5.
Plaintiff objects to this request as premature. Plaintiff has not yet decided which
experts (if any) he shall call as at trial. Plaintiff reserves all rights to call, retain, or use expert
witnesses, and any expert disclosures will be produced per CPLR § 3101(d).
6.
Not applicable.
7.
Plaintiff is not in possession of any statements.
8.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as vague and ambiguous, duplicative of Demand
No. 7, and overbroad in that it effectively seeks all relevant documents. Plaintiff shall not respond
to this patently improper demand; see also Response to Demand No. 7.
9.
See Response to Demand No. 8. Plaintiff further objects to this demand as
effectively incomprehensible inasmuch as Defendant asks Plaintiff to provide Defendant with a
summary of Defendant's oral statements.
10.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as vague and ambiguous as it is not clear what "any
other claim" means in the context of this lawsuit, and no such information is provided. As to (a)-
(d), Plaintiff answers: not applicable.
11.
Plaintiff objects to this request as premature. Plaintiff has not yet decided which
FOIL requests and responses (if any) he shall "use" in this case. Plaintiff reserves all rights to
"use" any FOIL requests and responses for any purpose in this litigation; and such information
will be produced only in response to a proper demand. Plaintiff further objects to this demand as
it seeks information created by, disclosed by, and already in the possession of, Defendant.
12.
Plaintiff is not in possession.
13.
Not applicable.
14.
See attached.
15.
Plaintiff is not in possession of any accident reports.
16.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as vague, ambiguous, and overbroad in that the
demand effectively seeks any document that may be construed to show notice. This is not a fishing
expedition, and many documents may be construed to show notice. Plaintiff construes this request
as seeking any Big Apple Corporation maps, and Plaintiff is not in possession of any responsive
documents.
17.
Plaintiff is not in possession of any photographs.
18.
Plaintiff objects to this request as premature. Plaintiff has not yet decided what
physical evidence (if any) he will use at trial. Plaintiff reserves all rights to use any physical
evidence at trial upon proper disclosure thereof to Defendant.
19.
Not applicable.
20.
Not applicable.
21.
Not applicable.
22.
Not applicable.
23.
See the attached HIPAA authorizations for:
Bellevue Hospital - 462 1st Avenue, New York, New York 10016.
24.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as patently improper, overbroad, vague, ambiguous,
and irrelevant. Defendant seeks all medical records of Plaintiff since birth-i.e., from before the
subject incident. Defendant is clearly not entitled to all such medical records; and none are
provided.
25.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as patently improper; Defendant is not entitled to
speak to Plaintiff's treating physicians, and certainly not at this stage, prior to any receipt or
exchange of medical records. No authorizations are provided.

Defendants. Defendants are referred to the NYSCEF docket.

38.
Plaintiff objects to this demand as vague and ambiguous. Plaintiff could receive
medical coverage from anybody. What matters is the entity from which Plaintiff did receive
medical coverage. This information is provided in Response to Demand No. 32; and authorizations
to obtain medical records from the actual providers are provided in response to Demand No. 23.
No additional authorizations are information are warranted, discoverable, or provided.

Not applicable.

51-56. Not applicable as the Plaintiff is not making a claim alleging negligent supervision.
57.
The City's ownership and control of R.N.D.C (and the Subject Location thereat) is,
upon information and belief, established by statute, not any specific document; and in any event,
any such documents would be in the sole and exclusive possession of Defendant. Accordingly, no
responsive documents are produced.
58.
See Response to Demand No. 57.
59.
See Response to Demand No. 57.
60.
See Response to Demand No. 11.

Q
At the time of the incident you were in
3
custody,
correct?
4
A
Yes.
5
Q
Were you serving a sentence or pending
6 a criminal case or something else?
7
A
I was, you know, I was un-sentenced.
I
8
was not sentenced. I was a detainee.
9
Q
Where were you being held as a
10
detainee?
11
A
On Rikers Island. On that day of the
12
incident, C-74. I believe it was RNDC, but they
13
changed the name. That is the Four Building.
14
Q
Let's start off with the criminal case
15
that you were a detainee, has that case been
16
resolved?
17
A
No.
18
Q
I am sorry?
19
A
No.
20
Q
Is it still pending?
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
Do you remember approximately when you
23
got arrested on those charges?
24
A
June 2020.
25
Q
From the date of the arrest were you
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
13
1
David Bookman
2
held in custody straight away from the
3
arraignment?
4
A
From when?
5
Q
You got arrested in June of 2020,
6
correct?
7
A
Yes.
8
Q
They process you through some county
9
central booking, correct?
10
A
Right.
11
Q
Then after seeing the judge either in
12
person or probably virtually, were you released or
13
remanded into custody?
14
A
I was in custody.
15
Q
When did you get released?
16
A
I got released a couple of months ago,
17
about two months ago, November '21.
18
Q
The housing unit at the Four Building,
19
was it a dormitory --
20
A
Yes.
21
Q
Dormitory?
22
A
Cells.
23
Q
Before the incident where you hurt your
24
jaw, how long were you in that housing unit?
25
A
Maybe a day or two, if that. Maybe a
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
14
1
David Bookman
2
couple. Not too long. Not too long.
3
Q
Let's say a few days before, were you
4
in a different housing unit somewhere else on
5
Rikers Island?
6
A
Yes.
7
Q
To your understanding or to what you
8
might know, the transfer to this building at Four
9
Building, do you know what the reason was or was
10
it just a routine transfer because they needed the
11 space? Do you have any idea why you got
12 transferred?
13
A
Well, to be honest with you, at the
14
time Rikers is a very dangerous and I was high
15
classification. So at that time they would just
16
randomly move you for numerous reasons.
17
Like they will move you because they
18
have to accommodate a lot of gang people too. So
19 the fact that I am neutral, they might have needed
20 my cell for a swap for somebody else coming from a
21
different building. So that is what they usually
22
do.
23
Q
So it was not as a result of an
24
incident that you got moved.
25
A
Well, to be honest with you, everything
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
15
1
David Bookman
2
is an incident on Rikers Island when you are in
3
there. There is nothing that is not an incident.
4
Your constantly involved in incidents all the
5
time.
6
MR. HINES: He is asking if you were
7
moved for some sort of disciplinary reason.
8
Right, is that the basis of your
9
question?
10
MR. BILLIG: Yes.
11
Q
Within a week before this incident,
12
were you involved in another incident which
13
required them to transfer you?
14
A
No.
15
MR. HINES: That you are aware.
16
MR. BILLIG: Yes.
17
Q
To your understanding, at Rikers Island
18
do they have you assigned as gang affiliated?
19
A
Not that I know of, no. They
20
shouldn't.
21
Q
But I think you mentioned, and I want
22
to use the right word, SO you indicated that you
23
believe that you were classified as a high level
24
classification.
25
A
Yes, of course. That is due to your
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
16
1
David Bookman
2
charges and your history. You automatically
3
become high classification?
4
Q
Do you know which specific housing unit
5
within the Four Building you were assigned to?
6
A
Well, for one I was assigned to
7
numerous housing units, but on the day of the
8
particular incident I was in, I believe it was in
9
the lower. I think it was 1 Lower.
10
Q
The notice of claim that was filed
11
indicates 2 Lower. Does that refresh your
12
recollection?
13
A
Yes. Yes, that could be it, 2 Lower.
14
Q
When you arrived at that housing unit,
15
did you know anyone in the housing unit from
16
either prior occasions at Rikers Island or from
17
the outside?
18
A
No.
19
Q
You were only in that housing unit for
20
a day or two before this incident began, correct?
21
A
Yes, a week tops I would say.
22
Q
Let's go with a week at the most.
23
During that time period before in this incident
24
occurred, did you have any altercations, problems
25
with any of detainees during the time period
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
17
1
David Bookman
2
before this incident?
3
A
May I ask you a question? Basically,
4
what you are asking me is, do any of the prior
5
incidents have do with this incident? Is that
6
what your asking me.
7
Q
What I am asking you is, for the time
8
period you were in that housing unit, which could
9
be one or two days or a week at most, did you have
10 any incidents or altercations with any other
11
detainees during that time period?
12
A
No. The time I was in that house, I
13
didn't have no altercations, but with that
14
incident.
15
Q
That is what I am asking. I am not
16 asking about other times in different places in
17
the building.
18
A
Okay, no. Because, all right, when I
19
was in that housing unit that day, that was the
20 only time that day. Not any other incidents I
21
ever had before that. Before that was isolated.
22
It had nothing to do with that. So no problems
23
that I ever had in my past or any disagreements or
24 anything that I ever had, had to do with that
25
incident that day.
516-485-2222

David Bookman
2
Q
About what time of day did the incident
3
begin?
4
A
I am going to be honest with you,
5
because, you know, when you in there, you are
6
inside. So the lighting is like you have no light
7 never. So I would say, it could have been, to me
8
at that time it felt like the afternoon, mid
9 evening. So I will say anywhere between 4:00,
10
5:00, SO maybe 6:00, 7:00 in the evening.
11
Q
Where within the housing unit were you
12
located when the incident began?
13
A
The dayroom and on the tier to the
14
cell, back to the tier.
15
Q
So were you on the tier or the hallway
16
leading back to your cell or were you in the
17
dayroom when it began?
18
A
The incident began in the dayroom.
19
Q
So let' S start off with five minutes
20
before the incident, were you in the dayroom?
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
What were you doing in the dayroom
23
before the incident began?
24
A
Watching I believe Chicago P.D., ,
25
watching Chicago P. D.

David Bookman
2
Q
Were you seated? Were you sitting
3
down?
4
A
Yes.
5
Q
Did something happen while you were
6
still seated watching TV?
7
A
Not at that time.
8
Q
How did the incident first begin?
9
A
One of the wardens, one of the
10
assistant wardens, the deputy warden, he wanted a
11 security team, a CO was doing a security walk.
12
Prior to them doing a walk, they had been moving
13
different gang members and numerous people in and
14 out of the housing unit the last day or two.
15
They, you know, just take out six bodies and move
16 in six more bodies.
17
So, when they came in, basically they
18
had just reopened that house. It was like a new
19 housing unit. We was complaining about the
20
conditions and, you know, utensils and things we
21
was entitled to that we did not have.
22
When she came in, we all, everybody in
23
the dayroom and down the tier and in their cells
24
came out to talk to them. When I went back in the
25
dayroom to sit down to continue watching TV and
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
20
1
David Bookman
2
waiting for them to maybe walk around and come
3
back. You know, I was giving her a chance to walk
4
around. Maybe she'll come back and talk to me
5 again.
6
So I went to sit down, because, you
7
know, I am not doing too good, physically. When I
8
went to sit down and watch TV, a guy just walked
9
up and snatched the remote control like from right
10
in front of me. Then when I went to look to see
11
what arm was it, he just punched me in my mouth.
12
Q
Were you holding the remote?
13
A
No, not at the time. I was not holding
14
it.
15
Q
Was the remote right next to you?
16
A
Yes, it was right next to me.
17
So when I went to observe him taking
18
the remote, I just wanted to look to see who was
19 reaching by me, you know. So when I went to look,
20
he swung and busted my lip.
21
Q
Was that a detainee?
22
A
Yes, that was a detainee.
23
When he did that
24
Q
Hold on. Hold on.
25
Do you know his name?
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
21
1
David Bookman
2
A
No, not offhand.
3
Q
Did he give you any indication that he
4
was going to punch you?
5
A
No, not at all.
6
Q
That initial punch, did he land it?
7
A
Yes, he busted my lip.
8
Q
After that initial punch, did the two
9
of you start fighting?
10
A
No, what he did was, he kind of like,
11
he went to flash me. Like he flashed me a
12
homemade knife and he ran. He ran, because when
13
he ran out of the dayroom, the dep and the
14
security officer was walking down the tier. So
15
when he ran
16
Q
So he struck you one time and then ran
17
out the room, basically.
18
A
Yes.
19
Q
Were you bleeding at that point?
20
MR. HINES: After flashing him the
21
weapon or the knife.
22
A
Yes, I had a little busted lip. I had
23
blood in my mouth. So you could see that I was
24
bleeding, yes.
25
Q
Did you see that he had a weapon in my
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
22
1
David Bookman
2
hand?
3
A
Yes, absolutely.
4
Q
Could you identify what the weapon
5
looked like?
6
A
Like a knife. Like a little knife.
7
It's a jail knife. Like a jail knife. Like some
8
Plexiglass something, screw. It was something.
9
Q
So at that point what did you decide to
10
do ?
11
,
A
When he punched me and pulled out the
12
knife, I decide to walk towards him, you know.
I
13
was actually upset, and as I was walking towards
14
him.
15
Q
Is this now out on the tier?
16
A
Yes. So as I get him, basically as I
17
am walking him, as I am walking towards him and I
18
am trying to like, you know, trying to defend
19
myself or whatever or stand tall.
20
Q
Let me ask this, at that point was the
21
first thing that you did go to report it to a CO
22
or was it to confront him?
23
A
When he swung at me, it was to swing
24
back, but I couldn't.
25

David Bookman
2
the room, correct?
3
A
No, listen, listen.
4
Q
No, answer my question. You said --
5
A
That is not correct.
6
Q
You said that after he hit you, he
7
flashed you the weapon and ran out of the room,
8
correct?
9
A
Yes, because when he swung at me and I
10
went to swing on him, he flashed me the weapon and
11
he eased out the dayroom, but I am still walking
12
behind him the whole entire time.
13
Q
After you were initially struck you
14
swung back at him correct?
15
A
No, I couldn't swing at him, because he
16
flashed the knife.
17
Q
Did you take a swing at him?
18
A
No, I couldn't.
19
Q
So he had the knife and you followed
20
him out of the dayroom.
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
Was that to go report it or to confront
23
him?
24
A
Yes.
25
Q
Which one, to confront him?

David Bookman
2
A
Yes, I was trying to confront him, but
3
I also wanted to get out of the dayroom too. Do
4
you understand?
5
Q
Now, what happened after you got out
6
onto the tier?
7
A
He runs by the dep and the security CO.
8
I tell the dep. I said, look he just punched me,
9
you know. He just assaulted me, because I had
10
blood in my mouth. She was like, oh, WOW. What
11
is going on? I am like, yo, he just swung at me.
12
The security officer, he basically
13
looked at me and he looked down the hall. And to
14
me, I kept telling him, yo, this guy just swung
at
15 me. Let me go. Let me get something. It was
16 busted. So I was starting to bleed.
17
So I don't remember if someone gave me
18 a tissue or if I went in my cell. I think I went
19 in the cell and tried to get some tissues. They
20 ended up walking me. The dep was like, let's walk
21 up the tier. I can't leave you in the cell like
22 this. I am like I am not staying here. This guy
23 just, you know, attacked me and put a knife on me.
24
So when I went back, as we walked
25
toward the dayroom, the security officer was kind
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
25
1
David Bookman
2
of mocking me and laughing at me that I had got
3
punched. He was telling me to do what I've got to
4
do.
5
I am like, man, I can't. I said that I
6
could barely walk, because I had a cane, you know,
7
due to my injuries and me being shot already. I
8
was like I am already physically, you know, beat
9
up, man. I can't be tussling nobody, man.
10
I am like I don't even know what
11
happened. You are bringing people in here that
12 just come in here swinging at people. I felt like
13
he was picking on me because I was the only one
14 walking with a cane. I was not supposed to be in
15 that housing unit.
16
So when he did that and I said that to
17 him, I guess the officer got mad that I explained
18 to him that I was not supposed to be there and I
19 needed medical attention.
20
So what he did was, he closed the
21
dayroom door and him and the deputy warden, they
22 walked out. When they walked out, I just remember
23
me going in my cell and, you know, me telling
24 another guy in the house that I seen that had been
25 in the house for a couple of days, you know. I
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
26
1
David Bookman
2
was just saying, yo, this is messed up. You know,
3
this dude just swung at me like this.
4
So, I ended up going past one of the
5
empty cells to get like another rag or something
6
to put on my mouth and grab a book. Then when I
7
went in that cell, one of the other guys attacked
8
me again.
9
Q
Is this a different guy?
10
A
Yes. So, now, while they are attacking
11
me, I am fighting them. They all come in the
12 cell. It's like three of them. So, as the guys
13
come in the cell, all I remember is me, you know,
14
they beat me up and stuff and swinging on me.
15
All I remember is me trying to slide
16 out. I just remember -- I don't know. Well, to
17 me it felt like being hit with a brick, but all
I
18
remember is the CO like just swinging on me and
19
hitting me and connecting with the side of my
20
face.
21
Q
So you are claiming that the CO struck
22
you.
23
A
Yes, he struck me too, definitely.
24
Q
Do you know the CO's name?
25
A
The reason why I don't know the CO's
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
27
1
David Bookman
2
name off the top of my head is because he was not
3
a steady. He was not like a steady officer. He
4
was a substitute CO for that day.
5
Q
Can you give me a physical description
6
of
him. Let's start with his height and weight?
7
A
I would say brown skin, about maybe one
8 fifty, about five seven, five eight, about five
9
nine. I will say about five eight, five nine, low
10
haircut, light eyes. He is like a black Hispanic.
11
He is like Dominican, but black.
12
Q
So this interaction or this melee,
13
about how long did it last?
14
A
I would say about a good five minutes,
15
ten minutes tops.
16
Q
How did it come to an end?
17
A
Because what happened was, one of the
18
guys, one of the COs started pushing a guy. And
19 one of the other guys, he actually like had a
20
knife. I guess, I don't know. I guess, I just
21
walked back. I just backed myself up and I walked
22
back out. So as one of the guys was coming toward
23
me, I just walked back.
24
Q
You were able to get yourself out of
25
the situation before
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
28
1
David Bookman
2
A
Yes.
3
Q
Was the emergency response unit called
4
or the Turtles called?
5
A
Yes, after. They eventually came.
6
They eventually came and then when they came, they
7
took just me to intake. They did not take me
8
straight to the clinic.
9
Q
Okay, hold on.
10
Now in connection with this incident,
11
were you issued a disciplinary ticket?
12
A
No.
13
Q
Were you ever questioned about this
14
incident by like investigators or anything like
15
that?
16
A
Not that I recall, no.
17
Q
From intake were you brought to the
18
clinic?
19
A
I don't know. Maybe an hour, hour and
20 a half, maybe two.
21
Q
Then you were brought to the medical
22
clinic?
23
A
Yes. Then in the medical clinic --
24
Q
Hold on.
25
When you get to the medical clinic,
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
29
1
David Bookman
2
what part or parts of your body did you complain
3
about?
4
A
You said when I got to the clinic?
5
Q
What did you complain about that was
6
hurt?
7
A
My jaw, my head, my back, but my jaw,
8
my face. It looked like I got hit by a Mac truck.
9
My face was out.
10
Q
From a medical point of view, what did
11
they do for you at the clinic, if anything?
12
A
The doctor looked at me. He told me my
13 jaw was broken and he said I needed to go to
14 urgent care. Then he looked at his watch and
15 said, hey, you can't go to urgent care tonight and
16
I don't know what to do. He got on the phone for
17
about like an hour or two and that was it.
18
I had to wait until the next day to go
19 to urgent care. Rikers, they didn't want to let,
20
they said they didn't have enough staff for
21
somebody to take me to the emergency room or to
22
call the ambulance. So I had to wait will until
23 the next day to change the tour for me to go to
24 urgent care. Then I went to urgent care.
25
Q
Hold on.
516-485-2222

David Bookman
2
So you were held in intake overnight,
3
correct?

A
Yes. Cold intake, no medication, no
5
pain medication.
6
Q
Then were you brought to I guess the
7
hospital facility on Rikers Island or where did
8
they bring you?
9
A
Yes, the hospital facility on Rikers
10
Island the next day.
11
Q
At the hospital facility at Rikers
12
Island the next day, what did they do for you?
13
A
They took X-rays.
14
Q
What did they tell you the X-rays
15
showed?
16
A
That I should have been in the
17
hospital.
It was broken.
18
Q
What was fractured?
19
A
My face and my jaw.
20
Q
Was the jaw fractured or was it the jaw
21
and something else?
22
A
Yes, it was my jaw.
23
Q
Let's start off with the left side or
24

6
right side of your face or at the chin?
7
A
I believe my left side.
8
Q
Do you know, was it the upper part or
9
the lower part?
10
A
Upper.
11
Q
When they told you at the hospital at
12
Rikers Island that you had a fractured jaw, did
13
they then treat it there or did they have you
14
brought to an outside facility?
15
A
They immediately, once the doctor did
16 that, they immediately transported me to Bellevue
17
Hospital.
18
Q
About how long during is that stay did
19
they keep you at Bellevue?
20
A
For about maybe, I underwent surgery.
21
I ended up doing surgery there, SO about five, six
22
days or maybe a week. You can say a week, about
a
23
week.
24
Q
In the surgery they wired your mouth
25
shut,
correct?

Yes, sir. I guess they wired it and
3
took out whatever bones or whatever else, teeth
4
they had to take out.
5
Q
Did you lose any teeth?
6
A
Yes.
7
Q
Did they have to pull the teeth?
8
A
I believe SO. .

Do you know how many teeth were
10
extracted or pulled?

19

20
in November?
21
A
Yes.
22
Q
When you arrived at NIC, you were
23
solely on a liquid diet, correct?
24
A
Yes, unfortunately.

BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
33
1
David Bookman
2
Island for follow ups to the doctor at Bellevue
3
Hospital?
4
A
No. They were supposed to, but they
5 wouldn't and they wasn't because they were short
6
of staff.
7
So like right now I am supposed to go
8
and get the metal out of my mouth. I was
9
complaining to them and until this day, I still
I
10
have the metal in my mouth.
11
Q
I am going to get to that.
12
Let's first start off with the wire.
13
At some point it got removed, correct?
14
A
Yes, the rubber bands. It's not wires.
15
They put the wires. The wires stay in your mouth.
16
It's the rubber bands.
17
Q
The rubber bands are what keep your
18
mouth enclosed, correct?
19
A
Yes.
20
Q
When were the rubber bands removed?
21
A
I will say about maybe, I will say
22 about maybe six weeks, seven weeks after they
23
start coming out by themselves.
24

While you were in NIC, periodically a
25
nurse would check on you, correct?

No.
3
Q
Did the medical staff ever examine you
4
during that time period?
5
A
They don't examine you, no. They don't
6
examine you, no. I made them look at me a couple
7
of times.
8
Q
So they did examine you. They looked
9
at you, correct?
10
A
Yes, due to me complaining and stuff
11
like that.
12
Q
So they saw you, correct?
13
A
Yes.
14
Q
The rubber bands, did they come out
15
themselves or were they removed?
16
A
Some, the majority of them came out by
17
themselves and the rest of them, the nurses
18
removed.
19
Q
Once the rubber bands were removed,
20
were you able at that point to start transitioning
21
to a soft food diet, like apple sauce, mashed
22
potatoes?

A
Not right away. Not at all, no.

A
I would say about, I put maybe about
13
twenty pounds on.
14
Q
Since you have been released, have you
15
seen a medical professional for your jaw or your
16 mouth?
17
A
Yes.
18
Q
Who did you see since you have been
19
released?
20
A
I've seen a few doctors. The first, I
21 went to the emergency room due to the pain and
22
you, you know, I just wanted to get this out of my
23
mouth.
24
Q
What hospital?
25
A
I went to Presbyterian, 168. What they
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
36
1
David Bookman
2
did was, they told me they recommended me to go
3
where they put it in my mouth. They wanted me to
4
go back to Bellevue.
5
They had gave me a number and stated,
6
you know, if I could not get in contact with
7
Bellevue to call I guess their hotline and they
8
will try to take it out from me.
9
What I ended up doing is, I ended up
10
going to my primary care doctor and just get
a
11
check up, you know, check my blood and pressure
12
and stuff. I told him what was going on with my
13
face and he gave me, he had gave me the number to
14
Bellevue where they did it at.
15
Because, you know, this happened when I
16
was in jail. So when I called, I have to actually
17 go in this week, this Wednesday.
18
Q
So do you have an appointment in two
19
days?
20
A
Yes. They didn't really want to give
21
an actual appointment, because they felt like they
22 didn't want to get in trouble, but the actual
23 surgeon people that is going to do it, will be in
24
Wednesday. So they were scared. They said it
25
should have been taken out of face, out of my
516-485-2222
BEE REPORTING AGENCY, INC.
212-327-3500
37

David Bookman
2
mouth and this is not good.

Wednesday, is that just like an appointment or do
5

6
A
God willing, I will going in and they
7
will be doing surgery.
8
Q
To remove the hardware or the wiring,
9
correct?
10
A
Yes. It might take a couple days, but,
11
yes, they will start it.
12
Q

13 medical treatment that you received for the
14
injuries in this incident?
15
A
Excuse me?
16
Q
Is there any additional medical
17
treatment that you received that we have not
18
discussed?
19
A
Well, no. What happened in my jaw, you
20

21
happened, like my eyes, my back. So I have other
22 problems, you know, other injuries too. It' S just
