*Manner in which
Claimant brings this claim to recover money damages for physical, psychological and emotional injuries sustained
claim arose:
and suffered by Claimant as a result of the negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, willful, deliberately indifferent,
and/or intentional conduct of the City of New York and/or New York City Department of Corrections ("DOC")--and
their agents, servants, and/or employees acting both individually and in concert and/or conspiracy with others
(collectively, "Respondents"). Claimant brings this claim to recover for the deprivation and violation of his due
process and civil rights, liberties, privileges, and immunities as secured by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of New York, the various statutes
of the United States of America, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. $$1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988, and the New
York State Civil Rights Laws, the New York City Civil Rights Laws, the New York Health Laws, and the New York
Corrections Laws; assault and battery; negligent hiring, training, retention and supervision of Respondents'
employees; failure to provide necessary and due medical treatment; failure to provide reasonable
accommodations; and Monell claims for deliberate or de facto practices, policies, procedures and/or customs of
violating constitutional rights of persons in Respondents' custody, control and care, including inmates and pretrial
detainees.
On or about June 7, 2021, in the dayroom of the Robert N. Davoren Center ("RNDC"), 2 Lower South, at a time
known to Respondents, Claimant-- a pretrial detainee who was then confined to the custody, control and care of
Respondents at RNDC--was attacked by another pretrial detainee. Respondents allowed the attack to happen,
observed the attack, failed to prevent or stop the attack, failed to provide medical attention to Claimant after the
attack, failed to write up or report the incident, and failed to subsequently separate Claimant from his attacker and
prevent a subsequent attack on Claimant. Shortly thereafter, as Claimant displayed visible signs of the recent
attack, Respondents permitted the same pretrial detainee and a friend to again attack Claimant while one of
Respondents' employees--believed to be a corrections officer-joined in the attack and attacked Claimant without
provocation or legal justification. Thereafter, Respondents again failed to provide Claimant with timely and
appropriate medical care for his objectively serious medical condition.
As a direct and proximate result of Respondents' conduct, Claimant has been caused to sustain and suffer severe
physical, psychological and emotional injuries of a permanent and progressive nature, deprivations and violations
of his common law, statutory and constitutional rights, pain and suffering, disability from usual activities, pecuniary
loss, scarring, disfigurement, shame and humiliation, and/or which have caused the claimant to incur and continue
to incur expenses for medical care and treatment.
